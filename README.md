# Python for data analysis. 

For this project, I had the opportunity to work with a fascinating dataset that compiles job postings from Google's search results for Data Analyst positions in the United States.
Key Learnings and Activities:
Library Support:
I began by setting up my Python environment with essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization. These included Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and NLTK for natural language processing.

Data Import and Initial Cleaning:
I imported the dataset, ensuring to convert date fields to the proper datetime format and dropping unnecessary columns. This setup laid a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

Data Integrity Check:
I conducted a thorough check to understand the dataset's completeness and integrity. I found some missing data points on specific dates and calculated the average number of job postings per day, which turned out to be 85 over 567 days.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Using visualizations, I explored various columns to identify the most common job titles, company names, locations, and other relevant attributes. This step was crucial in understanding the general landscape of Data Analyst job postings.

Data Cleaning:

Salary Cleaning: I processed the salary information to extract minimum, maximum, average, hourly, and yearly salaries, standardizing all salaries to yearly figures for consistency.
Description Cleaning: I tokenized the job descriptions to identify common keywords related to programming languages, libraries, analyst tools, and cloud services.
Skill Analysis:

Programming Languages: SQL, Python, and R emerged as the top programming languages, highlighting the skills in demand for Data Analyst roles.
Analyst Tools: Tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau were frequently mentioned, underscoring their importance in the field.
Visual Insights:
I created several visualizations to represent the distribution of salaries and the frequency of specific skills mentioned in job postings. These visual aids provided a clear picture of the current job market requirements for Data Analysts.

Reflection:
Today's exercise was incredibly insightful. It not only honed my data analysis skills with Python but also gave me a deeper understanding of the Data Analyst job market in the United States. I'm excited to apply these insights and continue my journey towards mastering data analysis.
